the backbone of a (pretty hopeless) attempt to create a backgammon game in java.

TODO:
-----
	change the layout of the board, so that 0 will be where the white eaten pills 
	are stored, instead of 24. with this, there will be no need to write extra code
	to handle how eaten pills will re-enter the board. (done :P)
