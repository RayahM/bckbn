The backbone of a (pretty hopeless) attempt to create a backgammon game in java.

To play a game against the computer, after compiling all the .java files run the
command 'java Test 3 0'. The first argument tells the program what depth you want
the Black player to look up to, and the second one does the same for the White player.
If you give the value '0' as depth, it it tells the program that a human is to 
play as that color. Recommended depth value is 3 for the time being, as it allows the 
computer to play a somewhat clever game, and is not too slow (3.5sec/move on average).
